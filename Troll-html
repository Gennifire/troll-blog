		<h2 >Troll song</h2>
    
			<p class="troll-song"> Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,<br>
			And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;<br>
			For many a year he had gnawed it near,<br>
			For meat was hard to come by.<br>
			Done by! Gum by!<br>
			In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,<br>
			And meat was hard to come by. </p>
        
			<p class="troll-song">Up came Tom with his big boots on. <br>
			Said he to Troll: "Pray, what is yon?<br>
			For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim,<br>
			As should be a-lyin' in graveyard.<br>
			Caveyard! Paveyard!<br>
			This many a year has Tim been gone,<br>
			And I thought he were lyin' in graveyard..."  <br> By: JRR tolkien</p>

       		 <p> Te story goes that the fires of musfilheim and the ice of jotenheim met. <br> 
        		This meeting of 2 opposing elements caused each to react to the other, the fires of musfelheim dimmed ever so slightly <br>
        		and the ice of jotenheim melted and dripped down upon the earth.</p>
        	<p> This water dripping down upon the earth gave life to the first being Ymir, who is said to be a being of life itself. <br>
        		His blood can create an explosion of life where it is shed, his breath breathes life, <br>
