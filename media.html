			<p class="troll-song"> Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,<br>
			And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;<br>
			For many a year he had gnawed it near,<br>
			For meat was hard to come by.<br>
			Done by! Gum by!<br>
			In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,<br>
			And meat was hard to come by. </p>
        
			<p class="troll-song">Up came Tom with his big boots on. <br>
			Said he to Troll: "Pray, what is yon?<br>
			For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim,<br>
			As should be a-lyin' in graveyard.<br>
			Caveyard! Paveyard! <br>
			This many a year has Tim been gone,<br>
			And I thought he were lyin' in graveyard..."  <br> By: JRR tolkien</p>
